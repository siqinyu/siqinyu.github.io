My name is Siqin Yu. I am a third-year PhD student in the department of [Energy Science and Engineering](https://ese.stanford.edu) at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu). My PhD advisor is Professor Ilenia Battiato. Before joining Stanford, I graduated with honor degree from the department of engineering mechanics (Tsien Excellence Engineering Program), **Tsinghua University**. My research interests include multiscale and multiphysics problems in geological porous media and engineered porous media. This is relevant to subsurface carbon sequestration, geological hydrogen storage and production, water filtration system, ion transport in battery system. I also work on metamaterials and soft material.
